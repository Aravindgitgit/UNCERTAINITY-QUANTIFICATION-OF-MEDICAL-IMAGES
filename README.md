# Uncertainity Quantification of Medical Images
🔍 Overview
This project focuses on Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in medical imaging using a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) with Monte Carlo Dropout. The goal is to quantify prediction uncertainty in Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, making medical image analysis more reliable.
The trained model is deployed using FastAPI, allowing real-time predictions and uncertainty visualization.

🎯 Features
✅ Medical Image Classification – Uses CNN with Bayesian inference for accurate predictions.
✅ Uncertainty Quantification – Estimates model confidence using Monte Carlo Dropout.
✅ FastAPI Backend – Provides an interactive API for real-time inference.
✅ REST API for Predictions – Users can upload medical images to receive predictions and uncertainty scores.
✅ Visualization of Uncertainty – Displays uncertainty maps for better interpretability.

🏗 System Architecture
The project consists of the following components:

1️⃣ Data Collection & Preprocessing – Medical image datasets are loaded, normalized, and augmented.
2️⃣ Model Training – CNN is trained with Monte Carlo Dropout for Bayesian inference.
3️⃣ Uncertainty Estimation – Multiple stochastic forward passes are used to estimate uncertainty.
4️⃣ Prediction API – FastAPI is used to create an endpoint for real-time model inference.
5️⃣ Visualization – Uncertainty maps are generated to interpret model confidence.
